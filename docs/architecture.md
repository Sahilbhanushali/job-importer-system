first i will tell all the steps from start till the end how i started and the go with the flow to complete the Task

starting with the backend first

created folder of server with npm init -y
then downloaded all the neccessary dependencies Such as mongoose express axios xml2js bullmq redis dotenv cors

started with running the server
creating connection between the database

after that in the same Config folder created config and database for the redis cloud as well

after that created two models one for the Jobs and second for the imported logs

created a queue using BullQueue and redis Client

after that Created Job Fetcher components that fetches the data from the API converts it into json format using xml2js and Send it to the queue
also added setinterval logic for that function and that function will be called every 1 hour that will fetch the data from the API and add it into the Queue

after that JobWorker Component whenever queue is updated workercomponent listens to it and import it into the Database
Using Worker of bullmq

after that created a Route and checked it into the browser
works perfectly

after that created next as client

created folders under app one for the server which will be in api and other for the client

inside api and folder name created routes that will hit the endpoints and fetches the data after that in pages using useEffect bring thaat data into frontend

things That can be doned better
i can use transactions Session for the Imports data that will be more secure if anythings happens in between the transactions end with the error
uses for more Secure Communication
websockets can be also implemented for the Live changes to get reflected without the refresh

things i learned from this task

first is redis and bullmq
i did not known what the messaging que is and how it works
redis concept i have read earlier but never used
also the xml parser i have never used

This document outlines the key logic and architectural choices made in the development of the Job Importer System.

## Core Components

### 1. **Job Fetcher **

- Fetches XML/RSS job feeds.
- Parses job data via `xml2js`.
- Adds all jobs to Redis queue via BullMQ .

### 2. **Redis Queue**

- Redis is used for queue management via **BullMQ**.
- It enables:
  - Background processing
  - Fault tolerance
  - Job retries & delays

### 3. **Job Worker **

- Runs as a separate Node process.
- Listens to `job-importer` queue.
- On receiving a job:
  - Checks if job already exists (`jobId`)
  - Updates or inserts new jobs
  - Logs the import event into `ImportLog`

## MongoDB Collections

### `jobs`

- Stores all job listings.
- Deduplicated based on `jobId`.

### `import_logs`

- Stores metadata of each import run:
  - Total fetched
  - New jobs
  - Updated jobs
  - Failed jobs

---

## Next.js API Routes (Client Side)

- `/api/import-logs`: Proxies Express API to fetch logs
- `/api/jobs`: Proxies Express API to fetch job listings

---

## Frontend Pages (Next.js)

### `app/page.jsx`

- Displays **Import History Table**
- Shows time, total jobs fetched, new, updated, failed
- Includes link to “View All Jobs”

### `app/jobs/page.jsx`

- Displays **Paginated Job Listings**
- Each job shows title, company, type, location, date, and link

---

## Integration Flow

server starts trigger job fetch
Jobs are queued into Redis
Worker pulls jobs from Redis, stores in MongoDB
Import logs are created for visibility
Frontend visualizes logs and jobs via API

## Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Setup MongoDB (MongoDB Atlas or local)
- [ ] Setup Redis (Redis Cloud or local)
- [ ] Deploy Express API (Render, Railway, etc.)
- [ ] Deploy Next.js frontend (Vercel, Netlify)
- [ ] Connect environment variables
